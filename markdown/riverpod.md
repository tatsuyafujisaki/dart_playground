# ProviderContainer versus ProviderScope
- [ProviderContainer](https://pub.dev/documentation/riverpod/latest/riverpod/ProviderContainer-class.html) is for a non-Flutter application and is equivalent to [ProviderScope](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_riverpod/latest/flutter_riverpod/ProviderScope-class.html) in a Flutter application.

# Which provider should I use?
- is the wrong question. `@riverpod` will chooses the right type of provider for you.
